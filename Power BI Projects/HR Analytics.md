## Recommendations
- Staff promotion should be defined and regular to eliminate uncertainty of career growth
- Provide support to staff to obtain further professional qualifications as required to further enhance professional development
- Work/Life balance should be encouraged by the introduction of employee benefit packages for their health and well being and support given when needed
- For those leaving for personal reasons, confidential counselling should be provided to staff that may need to talk
- Look into the 26 staff members who showed promotions before date of employment for accurate data and if they were paid salary, need for company to look into this as it could be considered a financial crime as may raise issues with audit
