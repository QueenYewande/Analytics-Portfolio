# STUDENTS' MENTAL HEALTH PROJECT

---

## Introduction

Mental health conditions are one of the leading causes of disability and poor life outcomes globally. One in every eight people globally lives with a mental health disorder, ranging from anxiety and depression to severe psychological issues. University and college students are especially vulnerable to mental health issues due to academic pressure, social challenges, and lifestyle changes.
The rising trend in diagnosed cases of mental illness among students has become an alarming concern. A report from the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) shows that one in four students in the U.S. experiences mental health challenges. In the UK, increased mental health issues among university students have also been recorded by institutional counselors. Various surveys further show that female students are more likely to report mental health issues than their male counterparts.
In a 2021 survey, nearly 30% of students acknowledged that anxiety had a negative impact on their academic performance. More than 20% reported being diagnosed with depression by healthcare professionals. Despite the existence of effective treatments, many students lack access to adequate mental health care. This project seeks to investigate the state of mental health among students and suggest actionable steps to improve their wellbeing.Mental health disorders affect 1 in every 8 people worldwide, with significant disturbances in thinking, emotional regulation, or behavior. Among students, mental health issues are a growing concern, particularly due to academic stress, social pressures, and the transition into adulthood.
Recent studies from organizations like the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) and universities in the UK highlight a rising trend in diagnosed mental health conditions in students. Female students, in particular, are more likely to report mental health concerns.
